Github repo for Stancon 2019 presentation material and R markdown

Run poststrat_pipeline_testing_age3_v2_posteriorvariance_markdown.R to create RData files that contain posterior bias values for every simulation.

After that, run threemodelwriteup_v2_posteriorvariance_markdown.R to produce bias facet plot seen in markdown pdf.

The simulation study with n=100 for the increasing true preference curve takes around 1 day for 200 simulations. 

Github repo for the Arxiv paper will be released soon, and simulation files will be very similar to the ones in this repo.
